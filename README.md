# DOM_Counter 
🧮 Counter Card Project – JavaScript DOM :
This project is a simple multi-counter card UI built using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.
It helped me practice and understand the fundamentals of :
- DOM selection and manipulation
- Updating UI dynamically using JavaScript
- Functions for increment, reset, and decrement
- Styling responsive card layouts
- Working with images and basic UI design
Each card includes its own counter with three controls :
> Increment
> Reset
> Decrement
This project is part of my journey to strengthen my basics in JavaScript and improve my front-end development skills.
